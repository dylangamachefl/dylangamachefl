# Hi there, I'm Dylan 👋

## About Me
I'm a data enthusiast passionate about building intelligent, practical applications. I'm currently working on a portfolio of projects to showcase my skills in both solving core business problems with data and leveraging cutting-edge AI models to build novel applications.

This portfolio showcases my ability to build end-to-end solutions, from complex agentic AI systems and high-performance web frontends to deep-dive business analytics that drive strategic decisions.

## 🚀 Featured Project: Multi-Agent AI Analyst

This is my most recent project, demonstrating advanced concepts in agentic AI.

*   **Project: Data-to-Analysis: A Multi-Agent AI Analyst**
    *   **Description:** An interactive web application that leverages a sophisticated multi-agent system, powered by the **Google Gemini API**, to automatically analyze a CSV dataset, derive strategic business insights, and generate a final, insightful data visualization. The system uses **Tree-of-Thought (ToT) reasoning** for chart selection and features **self-correcting agents** that can fix their own errors.
    *   **Live Demo:** [Live Demo](https://data-to-analysis-app.streamlit.app/)
    *   **Repo:** [GitHub - data-to-analysis-agent](https://github.com/dylangamachefl/data-to-analysis)

## 📊 Data Science & Analytics for Business Impact

This collection showcases end-to-end solutions to complex business problems, demonstrating skills in data cleaning, exploratory analysis, machine learning, and translating insights into actionable business strategy.

*   **Repo:** [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/dylangamachefl/data-analytics-portfolio)
*   **Project 1: Customer Analytics & Retention Strategy**
    *   **Description:** Reduced customer churn for a UK e-commerce retailer by segmenting over 540,000 transactions with RFM analysis and K-Means clustering. An XGBoost model was built to predict churn, identifying an immediate revenue risk of £112,000 and projecting a campaign ROI of over 1,100%.

*   **Project 2: Retail Demand Forecasting & Inventory Optimization**
    *   **Description:** Solved a critical supply chain challenge for Walmart by developing a LightGBM model to forecast weekly sales, achieving a highly reliable 8.19% WMAPE. The forecasts were then used to create a data-driven inventory policy to minimize costs while maintaining a 95% service level.

*   **Project 3: Credit Risk & Loan Default Prediction**
    *   **Description:** Built an interpretable machine learning model to minimize financial losses from defaulted loans. The final Random Forest model was optimized for business cost, not just accuracy, and is projected to reduce loan defaults by 80%, delivering an estimated **$2.1M in annual savings**.

## 🏆 Fantasy Football Suite

A collection of projects dedicated to applying data analysis and advanced AI to the world of fantasy football.

*   **Project 1: Fantasy Football Chatbot**
    *   **Description:** A conversational AI chatbot, powered by **LangChain and Google Gemini**, that uses a sophisticated **two-stage agentic architecture** to translate natural language questions into accurate SQL queries. This allows users to conversationally explore a league's historical database. Features include conversational memory and **self-correcting SQL generation**.
    *   **Live Demo:** [Live Demo](https://fantasy-football-chatbot.streamlit.app/)
    *   **Repo:** [GitHub - fantasy-football-chatbot](https://github.com/dylangamachefl/fantasy-football-chatbot)

*   **Project 2: WTStats - Fantasy League Hub**
    *   **Description:** A comprehensive, statically-generated web application built with **Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS** to serve as a historical archive for a fantasy football league. It features detailed dashboards, GM profiles, H2H stats, and deep-dive articles written in MDX. The entire site is pre-rendered using **Static Site Generation (SSG)** for maximum performance and reliability.
    *   **Live Demo:** [View Live Site](https://dylangamachefl.github.io/WTStats/)
    *   **Repo:** [GitHub - wtstats-nextjs](https://github.com/dylangamachefl/WTStats)
