# Hi there, I'm Dylan 👋

## 🎯 About Me
I am an AI developer passionate about building reliable autonomous agents and local-first systems. My focus is on moving beyond simple prototypes to learn the engineering realities of **production-grade AI**—including distributed systems, local inference, and multi-agent orchestration.

My portfolio is designed to demonstrate these skills through end-to-end applications that solve real-world problems using modern, privacy-focused stacks.

## 🚀 Advanced AI Projects

### 🎙️ 1. PodScribe: Distributed Transcription & RAG
> **Stack:** Redis Streams • Docker • FastAPI • WhisperX • Qdrant • Ollama

A production-grade monorepo for automated podcast processing. It coordinates multiple AI services (transcription, summarization, chat) using an event-driven architecture.

* **Distributed Systems:** Decouples services using **Redis Streams** to ensure reliable message processing, replayability, and independent scaling.
* **Hardware Optimization:** Implements a custom **Distributed GPU Lock** with an "Immediate Release" strategy to efficiently share CUDA resources between WhisperX and Ollama.
* **Hybrid Search:** Combines BM25 keyword search with Qdrant vector similarity using **Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)** for superior retrieval accuracy.

### 🏈 2. Fantasy Football Chatbot V2: Edge AI & WASM
> **Stack:** WebLLM • WebAssembly (WASM) • React 19 • DSPy • SQLite

A sophisticated **100% client-side** conversational agent. Unlike traditional chatbots, this runs the LLM entirely in the user's browser for zero-latency, private analysis.

* **Browser-Based Inference:** Utilizes **WebLLM** and **WASM** to run multi-billion parameter models (Qwen) directly on the client, removing the need for a backend API.
* **Teacher-Student Loop:** Implements a "flywheel" where a larger local model (Ollama) acts as a "Teacher" to generate synthetic data and optimize prompts for the smaller browser-based "Student" model.
* **Dynamic Context:** Uses smart semantic routing to prune complex SQL schemas, fitting them into the limited context window of browser-based models.

### 🛒 3. Grocery Deal Finder: Multi-Agent Vision Pipeline
> **Stack:** Google Gemma 3 • Transformers.js • Map-Reduce • Web Workers

An intelligent system that uses computer vision and a map-reduce pipeline to extract and match deals from weekly grocery ads against a user's shopping list.

* **Multi-Agent Orchestration:** A 4-agent pipeline (Vision Extractor, Librarian, Interpreter, Matcher) powered by **Google Gemma 3** to handle distinct stages of data processing.
* **Map-Reduce:** Implements parallel processing to handle large inventories, splitting items into shards for concurrent analysis by the "Inventory Librarian" agent.
* **Client-Side Vectors:** Runs **Transformers.js** in a Web Worker to classify thousands of products using vector embeddings locally, keeping the UI responsive.

### 📄 4. DocuQuery: Local-First Privacy RAG
> **Stack:** Ollama • LangChain • Microsoft Presidio • FAISS • RAGAs

A professional-grade RAG assistant designed for **100% data privacy**. All parsing, embedding, and inference happen locally on the user's hardware to prevent data leakage.

* **Privacy-First Architecture:** Orchestrates **Ollama** and **FAISS** (in-memory vector store) via Docker to keep all data off external clouds.
* **Security Guardrails:** Integrates **Microsoft Presidio** to automatically detect and redact PII (Names, Emails, SSNs) from user inputs before they reach the LLM.
* **Evaluation Pipeline:** Includes a dedicated container running **RAGas** to quantitatively measure retrieval "Faithfulness" and "Context Precision".
