# Hi there, I'm Dylan üëã

## About Me
I'm an AI/ML enthusiast passionate about building intelligent, practical applications. I'm currently working on building a portfolio of projects to showcase my skills in leveraging cutting-edge AI models, frameworks, and modern web technologies to solve real-world problems.

This portfolio showcases my ability to build end-to-end applications, from complex agentic AI systems to high-performance, data-driven web frontends.

## üöÄ Featured Project: Multi-Agent AI Analyst

This is my most recent and complex project, demonstrating advanced concepts in agentic AI.

*   **Project: Data-to-Analysis: A Multi-Agent AI Analyst**
    *   **Description:** An interactive web application that leverages a sophisticated multi-agent system, powered by the **Google Gemini API**, to automatically analyze a CSV dataset, derive strategic business insights, and generate a final, insightful data visualization. The system uses **Tree-of-Thought (ToT) reasoning** for chart selection and features **self-correcting agents** that can fix their own errors.
    *   **Live Demo:** [Live Demo](https://data-to-analysis-app.streamlit.app/)
    *   **Repo:** [GitHub - data-to-analysis-agent](https://github.com/dylangamachefl/data-to-analysis)

## üèÜ Fantasy Football Suite

A collection of projects dedicated to applying data analysis and advanced AI to the world of fantasy football.

*   **Project 1: Fantasy Football Chatbot**
    *   **Description:** A conversational AI chatbot, powered by **LangChain and Google Gemini**, that uses a sophisticated **two-stage agentic architecture** to translate natural language questions into accurate SQL queries. This allows users to conversationally explore a league's historical database. Features include conversational memory and **self-correcting SQL generation**.
    *   **Live Demo:** [Live Demo](https://fantasy-football-chatbot.streamlit.app/)
    *   **Repo:** [GitHub - fantasy-football-chatbot](https://github.com/dylangamachefl/fantasy-football-chatbot)

*   **Project 2: WTStats - Fantasy League Hub**
    *   **Description:** A comprehensive, statically-generated web application built with **Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS** to serve as a historical archive for a fantasy football league. It features detailed dashboards, GM profiles, H2H stats, and deep-dive articles written in MDX. The entire site is pre-rendered using **Static Site Generation (SSG)** for maximum performance and reliability.
    *   **Live Demo:** [View Live Site](https://dylangamachefl.github.io/WTStats/)
    *   **Repo:** [GitHub - wtstats-nextjs](https://github.com/dylangamachefl/WTStats)

## ü§ñ Hugging Face Projects

This collection showcases my skills in utilizing the Hugging Face ecosystem (Transformers, Inference API, Spaces) for various NLP and Computer Vision tasks.

*   **Project 1: Image Captioning Tool**
    *   **Description:** An interactive web application that generates descriptive captions for uploaded images using the `transformers` library to run a state-of-the-art model locally.
    *   **Live Demo:** [HF Image Captioning App](https://dylangamachefl-hf-image-captioning.hf.space)
    *   **Repo:** [GitHub - hf-image-captioning](https://github.com/dylangamachefl/hf-image-captioning)
*   **Project 2: Zero-Shot Text Classification**
    *   **Description:** An interactive web app that classifies text into user-defined categories using Hugging Face's zero-shot models via the Inference API.
    *   **Live Demo:** [HF Zero-Shot Text Classifier](https://dylangamachefl-hf-zero-shot-classifier.hf.space)
    *   **Repo:** [GitHub - hf-zero-shot-classifier](https://github.com/dylangamachefl/hf-zero-shot-classifier)
*   **Project 3: Text Translation Tool**
    *   **Description:** An interactive web app that translates text into various languages using the Hugging Face Inference API and Helsinki-NLP models.
    *   **Live Demo:** [HF Text Translator App](https://dylangamachefl-hf-text-translator.hf.space)
    *   **Repo:** [GitHub - hf-text-translator](https://github.com/dylangamachefl/hf-text-translator)
*   **Project 4: Sentiment Analysis App**
    *   **Description:** A web application that performs sentiment analysis on user-provided text using the Hugging Face Inference API and a DistilBERT model.
    *   **Live Demo:** [HF Sentiment Analyzer App](https://dylangamachefl-hf-sentiment-analyzer.hf.space)
    *   **Repo:** [GitHub - hf-sentiment-analyzer](https://github.com/dylangamachefl/hf-sentiment-analyzer)
