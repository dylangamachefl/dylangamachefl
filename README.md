# Hi there, I'm Dylan 👋

## 🎯 About Me
I am an AI developer passionate about building next-generation autonomous agents. My focus is on mastering the foundations of **enterprise-grade AI**—moving beyond simple prototypes to apply and learn the principles of **Reliability**, **Security**, **Auditability**, and **Evaluation**.

My portfolio is designed to demonstrate these skills through end-to-end applications that solve real-world problems.

## 🚀 Enterprise-Focused AI Agent Projects

This is a showcase of my primary projects, each built to demonstrate the core principles of reliable, auditable, and production-ready agentic AI.

### 1. Project: Data-to-Analysis: A Multi-Agent AI Analyst
A multi-agent system, powered by the **Google Gemini API**, that automatically analyzes a CSV dataset, derives strategic business insights, and generates a final data visualization.

* **Live Demo:** [Live Demo](https://data-to-analysis-app.streamlit.app/)
* **Repo:** [GitHub](https://github.com/dylangamachefl/data-to-analysis)

**Enterprise-Ready Features:**
* **`Reliability (Agentic Logic)`:** Uses **Tree-of-Thought (ToT) reasoning** for robust chart selection and features a **self-correcting agent** that can fix its own errors, ensuring a predictable and resilient logic flow.
* **`Reliability (Multi-Agent)`:** Designed as a collaborative "team" of agents (Data-Reader, Analyst, Chart-Generator) to break down a complex problem into modular, manageable, and more reliable components.
* **`Auditability (Tracing)`:** The entire agentic process is traced, allowing for debugging of the multi-agent 'chain of thought' and analysis of token usage and intermediate steps.

### 2. Project: DocuQuery: Conversational Document Assistant
An advanced conversational RAG assistant for chatting with PDF, Word, and text files, built with a focus on accuracy and conversational context.

* **Live Demo:** [Live Demo](https://docu-query-001.streamlit.app/)
* **Repo:** [GitHub](https://github.com/dylangamachefl/docu-query)

**Enterprise-Ready Features:**
* **`Reliability (Advanced RAG)`:** Built with a **Two-Stage Conversational RAG Architecture** to provide accurate, source-backed answers. Uses **History-Aware Retrieval** to maintain context in multi-turn conversations.

### 3. Project: Fantasy Football SQL-Agent Chatbot
A specialized agent that translates natural language questions ("Who had the most points last week?") into accurate SQL queries to conversationally explore a sports database.

* **Live Demo:** [Live Demo](https://fantasy-football-chatbot.streamlit.app/)
* **Repo:** [GitHub](https://github.com/dylangamachefl/fantasy-football-chatbot)

**Enterprise-Ready Features:**
* **`Reliability (Structured Output)`:** Leverages a **two-stage agentic architecture** with **self-correcting SQL generation** to ensure queries are syntactically correct and robust against user error.
* **`Security (Red Teaming)`:** Proactively 'red-teamed' the agent to test for and patch vulnerabilities, such as prompt injection attacks attempting to run malicious SQL (e.g., `DROP TABLE`).
* **`Auditability (Tracing)`:** All natural language inputs, agent 'thoughts,' and final generated SQL queries are traced for debugging, performance monitoring, and root cause analysis.

## 📊 Foundational Projects & Business Acumen

A collection of projects that demonstrate my foundational ML skills, full-stack capabilities, and ability to connect technical solutions to business impact.

* **Project: End-to-End Data Science for Business Impact**
    * **Description:** A portfolio of three end-to-end data science projects demonstrating strong business acumen. These projects (Customer Churn, Demand Forecasting, and Credit Risk) show my ability to connect complex ML models (XGBoost, LightGBM) to direct financial outcomes (e.g., +1,100% ROI, $2.1M in projected savings).
    * **Repo:** [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/dylangamachefl/data-analytics-portfolio)

* **Project: WTStats - Full-Stack Application**
    * **Description:** A comprehensive, high-performance web application built with **Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS**. Demonstrates skills in full-stack development and **Static Site Generation (SSG)** for a reliable, production-ready user experience.
    * **Repo:** [GitHub - wtstats-nextjs](https://github.com/dylangamachefl/WTStats)

* **Project: Hugging Face Mini-App Collection**
    * **Description:** A monorepo of smaller web apps built to demonstrate proficiency with the Hugging Face ecosystem (Transformers, Inference API, and Spaces), covering foundational NLP and Computer Vision tasks.
    * **Repo:** [GitHub - huggingface-project-suite](https://github.com/dylangamachefl/huggingface-project-suite)
