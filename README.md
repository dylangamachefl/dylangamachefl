# Hi there, I'm Dylan üëã

## About Me
I'm an aspiring AI/ML enthusiast passionate about building intelligent, practical applications. I'm currently working on building a portfolio of projects to showcase my skills in leveraging cutting-edge AI models and frameworks to solve real-world problems.

This portfolio showcases my ability to build end-to-end AI applications using modern tools like Google Gemini and the Hugging Face ecosystem.

## üöÄ Featured Project: Multi-Agent AI Analyst

This is my most recent and complex project, demonstrating advanced concepts in agentic AI.

*   **Project: Data-to-Analysis: A Multi-Agent AI Analyst**
    *   **Description:** An interactive web application that leverages a sophisticated multi-agent system, powered by the **Google Gemini API**, to automatically analyze a CSV dataset, derive strategic business insights, and generate a final, insightful data visualization. The system uses **Tree-of-Thought (ToT) reasoning** for chart selection and features **self-correcting agents** that can fix their own errors.
    *   **Live Demo:** [Data-to-Analysis App on Streamlit Cloud](https://data-to-analysis-app.streamlit.app/)
    *   **Repo:** [GitHub - data-to-analysis-agent](https://github.com/dylangamachefl/data-to-analysis)

## ü§ñ Hugging Face Projects

This collection of projects showcases my skills in utilizing the Hugging Face ecosystem (Transformers, Inference API, and Spaces) for various Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV) tasks.

*   **Project 1: Image Captioning Tool**
    *   **Description:** An interactive web application that generates descriptive captions for uploaded images. This version directly utilizes the Hugging Face `transformers` library to load and run a state-of-the-art image captioning model locally within the application's environment.
    *   **Live Demo:** [HF Image Captioning App](https://dylangamachefl-hf-image-captioning.hf.space)
    *   **Repo:** [GitHub - hf-image-captioning](https://github.com/dylangamachefl/hf-image-captioning)
*   **Project 2: Zero-Shot Text Classification**
    *   **Description:** An interactive web application that classifies input text into user-defined categories using Hugging Face's zero-shot classification models via the Inference API.
    *   **Live Demo:** [HF Zero-Shot Text Classifier](https://dylangamachefl-hf-zero-shot-classifier.hf.space)
    *   **Repo:** [GitHub - hf-zero-shot-classifier](https://github.com/dylangamachefl/hf-zero-shot-classifier)
*   **Project 3: Text Translation Tool**
    *   **Description:** An interactive web application that translates text into various languages. Built with Python and Streamlit, it leverages the Hugging Face Inference API and Helsinki-NLP models to provide real-time translations.
    *   **Live Demo:** [HF Text Translator App](https://dylangamachefl-hf-text-translator.hf.space)
    *   **Repo:** [GitHub - hf-text-translator](https://github.com/dylangamachefl/hf-text-translator)
*   **Project 4: Sentiment Analysis App**
    *   **Description:** A web application that performs sentiment analysis on user-provided text. It utilizes the Hugging Face Inference API with the `distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english` model and features a user interface built with Streamlit.
    *   **Live Demo:** [HF Sentiment Analyzer App](https://dylangamachefl-hf-sentiment-analyzer.hf.space)
    *   **Repo:** [GitHub - hf-sentiment-analyzer](https://github.com/dylangamachefl/hf-sentiment-analyzer)
